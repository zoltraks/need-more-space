Naming conventions
------------------

Depending on the database server, database catalog names are written in **PascalCase** (SqlServer) or **underscore_case** (MySQL).

This may also apply to table names, in a limited scope.

When it comes to table names, singular rather than plural names are preferred.

Style conventions
-----------------

Tab characters are not used in a favour of double space.
