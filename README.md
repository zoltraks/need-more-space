Need More Space
===============

Hello, comrade. 

Here you will find a set of utility functions for your database.

This repository contains scripts for installation of selected utility functions.

[Jump to **Microsoft SQL Server** tools](docs/source/sqlserver.md)

[Jump to **MySQL** tools](docs/source/mysql.md)

Notes
-----

Scripts are saved in **UTF16-LE** encoding because GitHub preview lacks indentation with spaces when using **UTF-8** (with or without BOM). 
Sorry for that.
